1. Write a statement to solve for x in Java:
a = 15;
b = 30;
3 * x - 5 = ((a + b) * 72) / (34 * 45) + 12
x = ?

2. Modify the above to work for any value of a and b.

3. Given that Math.PI gives you the value of PI, output  the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 30 cm and a height of 50 cm.

4. Given that the side length of a cube is 10 m, output the surface area of the cube?
