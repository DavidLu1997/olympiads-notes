# Olympiads Notes

Throughout my time at Olympiads School, I have taught many classes. The notes for all my classes will eventually be up here.

For now, I have my Summer 2016 notes available:

- [Web Development (Junior)](webdev)
- [Introduction to Java](java) (NOTE: Not my notes, only my examples)
- [Computer Contest Level 1](compcont)

I also have some presentations available for my seminars at Olympiads School, [here](presentations).
